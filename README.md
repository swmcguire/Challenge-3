# Password-Generator
Challenge 3 - Random Password Generator

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

Due to the ongoing needs of security in the work place I was tasked to create an application that allows employees to generate random passwords based on a set of criteria that they chose.  Employees are given a set of criterion to select for: 

-Length between 8 and 128
-Includes lowercase letters (Yes or No)
-Includes uppercase letters (Yes or No)
-Includes numbers (Yes or No)
-Includes special characters (Yes or No)

This project was incredibly tricky but it forced me to dig deep and pull many different skills together.  I learned that I am still new to coding and although the code may be a bit sloppy and there is probably a better/ cleaner way to do it I was able to get the task accomplished.

## Installation

No Installation is needed - one can simply navigate to the web address here and begin randomizing their next password.
